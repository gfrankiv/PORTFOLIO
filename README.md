# **PORTFOLIO**
## **About me**
My name is Halyna Frankiv. Recently I decided to change my career path. I liked the IT branch and it attracked me a lot for the last years. I've got already some experience with content creating(copywriter), PPC and linkbuilding, but it wasn't it. I understood that I could do something more difficult and more interesting. My primary specialty was a teacher of English and German. As I can teach someone, I also know, how to study by my own. And after testing courses and self-study I've understood how necessarry and substantial software testing is. It's so important to create the things of high quality. I'm going to prove the acquired skills and to develope myself for further proceedings.
